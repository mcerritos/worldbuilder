## worldbuilder
Worldbuilder is a website that allows you to collect, save, and access information on a fictional world of your own creation. 

## Scope 	
Worldbuilder allows users to create a small wiki for a conworld (created world) of their own construction. 

## Technologies
	Worldbuilder is constructed using HTML, CSS, UIkit and Django.  
  
## User Stories

My user is someone who is constructing a fictional world, like a writer, an artist or a dm for a tabletop game, and wants to keep track of information about that conworld. Users can login, add information about their world, and also easily reference that information when they need to remember something. 
User Story 1: A user registers to make a new account. They enter their email address and username. They are redirected to a new profile page, where they are given the ability to create a new conworld. 
User Story 2: A user creates a new conworld. They decide what domains they are interested in and hit enter. The domains appear on the navbar. The user clicks on a domain, “Warfare.” They fill in the information about warfare on their world. 
User Story 3: A user wants to fill in the information for their world, but they don’t know. They go to the notes section at the bottom of the page and add a note to come back to “weapons that are popular in the area.”
